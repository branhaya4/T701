  <h2 id='internetTitle'>| What is the Internet?</h2>
  <p class='text1'>The Internet, as its name suggests, is an interconnected network of devices. These devices work together with an Internet Service Provider (ISP). The ISP connects you to the other computers on the network, giving us access to services such as email, telephone calls (VoIP) and web hosting.<br><br>
    The aforementioned ‘interconnected network’ is what we call the World Wide Web (WWW). To access pages/devices on the WWW, we use an internet browser. Things like Google Chrome and Firefox are all examples of browser software programs. The content on these websites are crowd-sourced, meaning that anyone with proper credentials is able to put content on it. This affects the reliability of some results. <br><br>

    The Internet is hosted on a bunch of computers in large buildings owned by different companies. These servers can host websites and services. When data is stored in these servers instead of a local storage medium, it’s referred to as ‘being in the cloud’. Services such as Google Drive hold your data in the cloud so that it is universally accessible from any device with the correct credentials.</p>

  <h2 id='personalTitle'>| Types of Attacks - Personal</h2>
  <p id='personalIntro'>Unfortunately, despite all the perks the Internet provides, there are a multitude of ways you can get attacked maliciously by other users. These types of attacks use <b>malware</b> to infect your computer and can have many adverse effects. Let's take a look at the types of malware. </p><div class='types' id='spyware'>
  <ul>
    <li>Most of the time, spyware is very discreet and tries to draw as little attention to itself as possible. It aims to steal your data, such as what you type into your keyboard, what websites you frequently visit and other personal information. This information can be sold to companies or government agencies to target advertisements at you.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <div class='types' id='adware'>
    <ul>
      <li>Adware is a less aggressive but much more common form of malware, where sponsored advertisements are forcefully displayed on a user’s screen. Companies often do this to collect loads of ad revenue from the sponsors.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class='types' id='viruses'>
    <ul>
      <li>When a virus is executed, it replicates itself quickly and inserts its code into multiple sections of your computer. It can delete, replace, create or edit files onto your computer, and even use your computer to spread itself onto other machines.The hacker can also choose to use your computer as a storage device, taking up a portion of your hard disk. It’s often very easy to recognise when a machine is infected with a virus.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class='types' id='worms'>
    <ul>
      <li>Worms are similar to viruses, where they replicate and infect. The only difference is that a worm does not need human intervention to execute. This means that you can download a worm, never run it, and still have it infect your computer. It has similar adverse effects as a virus.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class='types' id='trojans'>
    <ul>
      <li>A trojan is any malware that disguises itself as something non-malicious. The effects of a trojan are often similar to those of a virus and worm, however it cannot self-replicate. These are most often either sent as spam emails/texts, or found on pirating websites. It needs to be run to infect your computer.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class='types' id='ransomware'>
    <ul>
      <li>Ransomware removes your ability to access your system files and computer until you pay the hacker a sum of money. This transaction is often done via Bitcoin.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class='types' id='phishing'>
    <ul>
      <li>Phishing attacks steal a user’s login credentials by pretending to be the host site the user is attempting to access. An example would be a fake delivery service asking for the victim to login so that they can confirm the delivery, but in reality it just steals the login data and uses it for other purposes.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="botnets">
    <ul>
      <li>When a group of computers gets hacked by one individual, they have the ability to create a <b>botnet</b>. The hacker will use a portion of your hard disk and CPU to do whatever the hacker wants. Botnets are often used to perform DDoS attacks or storing illicit material. Using a botnet decreases the chance of the hacker being tracked down by the authorities.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<section class='massTypes' id='mass'>
  <h2 id="massIntro">| Types of Attacks - Mass</h2>
  <div class='mTypes' id='ddos'>
    Now that we’ve discussed personal attacks, we can take a look at coordinated attacks directed against larger entities, such as corporations and governments.
    <br><br>
    The most common type of mass attack is a DDoS/DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attack. DDoSes are attacks where computers are used to flood a server with millions of 'spoofed' requests, rendering it unable to respond to actual legitimate requests. This essentially disallows anyone to connect to the website. A DDoS attack is similar, except multiple computers attack the same server together, hence 'distributed'. DDoS attacks have less traceability and increased effectiveness compared to DoS attacks.
    <br><br>
    DDoS attacks are most common on political websites or high-profile sites, such as banks and credit card payment servers. People have a wide range of reasons to initiate a DDoS attack against a site, most commonly out of spite for the specific company/entity. Rarely, DDoS attacks are used for 'back-dooring' (gaining access to encrypted/protected files and data) specific sites.
    <br><br>
    Recently in February 2020, Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered from a DDoS attack, where an unidentified AWS customer was targeted. It used an exploit on a third-party server (CLD-AP - Connectionless Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) to amplify the amount of data sent to the user anywhere between 56 to 70 times. The attack lasted 3 days and peaked at an absolutely astounding 2.3 terabytes of data per second. Although the effects were not devastating, as only a few customers were targeted, it conveyed the message pretty well - no one is invincible.

  <h2 id="prevenIntro">| Preventative Measures</h2>
  <div id='firewall'>
    <p>After all that, we need to learn ways that a user can protect themselves. There are many ways we can reduce the risk of us getting hacked:</p>
    <p><b>Having a basic sense of vigilance</b> - never open unknown files from people you don’t know. You should also have a program automatically screen incoming files for harmful programs.</p>
    <p><b>Antivirus Software</b> - Antivirus software holds a large dictionary of harmful code snippets so that it can flag and delete them before they cause any harm. The list is constantly updated, and the best antivirus programs has the largest dictionary. </p>
    <p><b>Firewalls</b> - A firewall acts similarly to an antivirus, but it's more general and can act on a network level instead of locally. It filters through all the data that is sent through, and checks whether it passes a set of rules. Exceptions can be made in a firewall’s software. </p>
    <p><b>2FA / MFA</b> - Two-Factor Authentication and/or Multi-Factor Authentication makes that even if someone has your password, they still won't be able to access your account. MFA sends a confirmation to a device of choice, or verifying using a temporary code generated by another device.</p>
    <img src="https://149360532.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/2FA_flow_transp.png" id="2faImage" alt="image showing how 2FA works" width="100%" height="100%">
  </div>

  <div id="misconceptions">
    <h2>| Common Misconceptions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Frequently backing up your files does not necessarily protect you from viruses.</b> When backing up, you could easily place the malicious code in the backup as well. This becomes very common with discreet malware, such as spyware or a worm.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Having a complex password doesn't make you safe. </b>If people only used 1 password for all the sites and services they sign up to, hackers get essentially unlimited access to everything they own on those platforms. This can be mitigated by either using 2FA, or by using a password generator / saver to store random passwords.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>A firewall does not make you invincible.</b> I mean, just look at what happened with AWS - some of the most powerful cyber-security in the world was still breached by hackers. Commercial firewalls have their weaknesses, and sometimes users can also be tricked into whitelisting malicious software to be downloaded. Always use logic to check files before downloading / whitelisting.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Even if nothing seems wrong, there can still be malicious code running on your computer.</b> The previously mentioned discreet malware most often don't change anything appearance-wise, which is why doing regular scans with antivirus software is important in keeping your data safe.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Hackers can and will target random people sometimes.</b> Some hackers just want to cause chaos, and that involves ruining random people's day. If your data is not secured, you can fall victim to a cyberattack at any time. </li>
    </ul>

<section id='hack' class="hack">
  <h2 id="hackerTitle">|  Hackers and Hacking</h2>
  <p id="hackerInfo">Lastly, let's take a look at the people doing these things - hackers. Currently, we have 3 classifications of hackers: </p>
  <div class='hackers' id='whitehat'>
    <p><b>Whitehat Hackers</b> - Whitehat hackers are paid by corporations to try and break into their systems. All bugs and vulnerabilities are reported, and they are compensated for such. This is considered to be the most ethical type of hacking.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="hackers" id="blackhat">
    <p><b>Blackhat Hackers</b> - Blackhats are your classic movie evil villain. They break into private files and steal data, abusing as many vulnerabilities they can find. Blackhat hacking is unethical and illegal. </p>
    <br>
  </div>
  <div class="hackers" id="greyhat">
    <p><b>Greyhat Hackers</b> - Greyhats are a blend of the previous 2 types. They rarely official work for anybody, and they still find exploits in systems. However, instead of offering a solution to fix them, they ask the company for payment in return for patching the bug. Whether this type of hacking is ethical or not is debated.</p>
