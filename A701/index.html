     <h2 id='internetTitle'>| What is the Internet?</h2>
      <p class='text1'>The Internet, as its name suggests, is an interconnected network of devices. These devices work together with an Internet Service Provider (ISP). The ISP connects you to the other computers on the network, giving us access to services such as email, telephone calls (VoIP) and web hosting.<br><br>

        The aforementioned ‘interconnected network’ is what we call the World Wide Web (WWW). To access pages/devices on the WWW, we use an internet browser. Things like Google Chrome and Firefox are all examples of browser softwares. The content on these websites are crowd-sourced, meaning that anyone with proper resources is able to put content on it. This affects the reliability of some of the results. <br><br>
        
        The Internet is hosted on a bunch of computers in large buildings owned by different companies. These servers can host websites and services. When data is stored in these servers instead of a local storage medium, it’s referred to as ‘being in the cloud’. Services such as Google Drive hold your data in the cloud so that it is universally accessible from any device with the correct credentials.</p>

    <h2 id='personalTitle'>| Types of Attacks - Personal</h2>
     <p id='personalIntro'>Unfortunately, despite all the perks the Internet provides, there are a multitude of ways you can get attacked maliciously by other users. These types of attacks use <b>malware</b> to infect your computer and can have many different adverse effects. Let's take a look at the types of malware. </p>
     
     <div class='types' id='spyware'>
       <ul>
         <li>Most of the time, spyware is very discreet and tries to draw as little attention to itself as possible. It aims to steal your data, such as what you type into your keyboard, what websites you frequently visit and other personal information. This information can be sold to companies or government agencies to target advertisements at you.
        </li>
       </ul>
     </div>
 
     <div class='types' id='adware'>
       <ul>
         <li>Adware is a less aggressive but much more common form of malware, where sponsored advertisements are forcefully displayed on a user’s screen. Companies often do this to collect loads of ad revenue from the sponsors.
        </li>
       </ul>
     </div>
 
     <div class='types' id='viruses'>
       <ul>
         <li>When a virus is executed, it replicates itself quickly and inserts its code into multiple sections of your computer. It can delete, replace, create or edit files onto your computer, and even use your computer to spread itself onto other machines.The hacker can also choose to use your computer as a storage device, taking up a portion of your hard disk. It’s often very easy to recognise when a machine is infected with a virus.
        </li>
       </ul>
     </div>
 
     <div class='types' id='worms'>
      <ul>
        <li>Worms are similar to viruses, where they replicate and infect. The only difference is that a worm does not need human intervention to execute. This means that you can download a worm, never run it, and still have it infect your computer. It has similar adverse effects as a virus.
        </li>
      </ul>
     </div>
 
     <div class='types' id='trojans'>
      <ul>
        <li>A trojan is any malware that disguises itself as something non-malicious. The effects of a trojan are often similar to those of a virus and worm, however it cannot self-replicate. These are most often either sent as spam emails/texts, or found on pirating websites. It needs to be run to infect your computer.
        </li>
      </ul>
     </div>
 
     <div class='types' id='ransomware'>
      <ul>
        <li>Ransomware removes your ability to access your system files and computer until you pay the hacker a sum of money. This transaction is often done via Bitcoin.</li>
      </ul>
     </div>

     <div class='types' id='phishing'>
      <ul>
        <li>Phishing attacks steal a user’s login credentials by pretending to be the host site the user is attempting to access. An example would be a fake delivery service asking for the victim to login so that they can confirm the delivery, but in reality it just steals the login data and uses it for other purposes.
        </li>
      </ul>
